# YAGNI Principle in Software Engineering

## Introduction  
The **YAGNI Principle** stands for **“You Aren’t Gonna Need It”**.  
It is a guideline from **Extreme Programming (XP)** that says: *“Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.”*  

This principle helps developers avoid adding features, code, or complexity that may never be used.

## Explanation  
- **Avoid premature features** – Adding code for future requirements increases maintenance overhead.  
- **Keeps codebase lean** – The system remains smaller, faster, and easier to understand.  
- **Focus on actual needs** – Developers work on solving real problems, not hypothetical ones.

## Example in Java  

### Bad Practice (Violates YAGNI):  
```java
class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private String address;
    private String phoneNumber;
    private String twitterHandle; // Not needed now, but added "just in case"

    // Constructor
    public User(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }

    // Extra unused getter and setter for twitterHandle
    public String getTwitterHandle() {
        return twitterHandle;
    }

    public void setTwitterHandle(String twitterHandle) {
        this.twitterHandle = twitterHandle;
    }
}
```  
Here, `twitterHandle` is added **without any requirement**. This increases complexity unnecessarily.  

### Good Practice (Follows YAGNI):  
```java
class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;

    // Constructor
    public User(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }
}
```  
This version keeps the class **simple and focused** on current requirements. If `twitterHandle` is ever needed, it can be added later.

## Real-World Analogy  
Imagine building a **house**. You decide to install a swimming pool, gym, and theater “just in case” guests might want them. But if nobody uses them, you wasted money, time, and resources. Similarly, adding unused code wastes effort and makes maintenance harder.  

---

## Conclusion  
The **YAGNI Principle** helps developers stay focused on what is truly required. By avoiding speculative features, projects remain simpler, faster to build, and easier to maintain. Always remember: *“Don’t build what you don’t need.”*
